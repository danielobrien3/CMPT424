2019 Browser-based Operating System in TypeScript
=================================================

This is Alan's Operating Systems class project.
See http://www.labouseur.com/courses/os/ for details.
It was originally developed by Alan and then enhanced by Bob Nisco and Rebecca Murphy over the years.
The additional work has been done by me, Daniel O'Brien. This includes all commits you see in this repository

What is this the purpose of this project?
================

This project is meant to provide students with hands-on experience building a virtual operating system. It is the practical half of the course, with the theory-side built in to the lectures. However, this project is important for more than just providing a practical understanding of how Operating Systems are built and used. It also provides experience building a large-scale system. This forces students (like myself) to use good coding practices, such as leveraging modularity, code comments, efficient algorithms, and more. 


What is this the timeline of this project?
================

This project has 4 major milestones, the last of which will be completed by December 2019.

How has this project made me a more valuable developer. 
================

This project is a software development task that just keeps on giving. One reason for this is the practical knowledge that comes as a result of building an Operating System. This provides a low-level knowledge of how computers operate, which can be invaluable in the debugging process. The low-level knowledge provided is also invaluable for creating resource-efficient programs. Finally, it has made me a more valuable developer by its sheer size. As stated above, this is a project so large in size that the only way the codebase (and my sanity) can be maintained is through proper coding practices. This includes self-documenting code, tons of comments, and proper modularization.
